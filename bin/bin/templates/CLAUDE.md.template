## Project Overview

<!-- TODO: Add brief project description -->

## Thoughts Directory

This project uses a `.thoughts/` directory for persistent context:

```
.thoughts/
├── research/      # Codebase research notes
├── plans/         # Implementation plans (created by /create-plan)
├── designs/       # Design documents
├── structures/    # Structure documents
├── tickets/       # Ticket documentation
├── prs/           # PR descriptions
├── reviews/       # Code review reports
```

### Usage

- **Research**: Document codebase findings in `.thoughts/research/`
- **Plans**: Store implementation plans in `.thoughts/plans/`
- **Designs**: Record architectural designs in `.thoughts/designs/`
- **Tickets**: Keep ticket context in `.thoughts/tickets/`

### Conventions

- The `.thoughts/` directory is gitignored
- Use descriptive filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
