# Personal AI glossary setup

Run this skill's `manage.py`; it performs the file transformation rather than
asking the harness to interpret an import. The canonical vocabulary remains in
`<data home>/glossary.md`. Setup and repair copy its complete current content
between managed markers in each installed global instruction file:

- Claude Code: `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/CLAUDE.md`
- AGENTS.md-based Codex harnesses: `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/AGENTS.md`

By default (no `--claude-file` or `--agents-file`), a target that does not
already exist on disk names a harness that is not installed, so it is left
alone and never created; only targets that already exist are synchronized.
Passing a path explicitly always writes it, creating any missing parent
directories and the file itself. This keeps a Codex-only or Claude-only
installation from gaining an unused config file. Only active targets receive a
generated managed block.

The **data home** is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ai-glossary/`, falling back to
`~/.config/ai-glossary/` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset or empty. The script
expands these defaults itself. Use its
path from this skill's folder, regardless of the current working directory.

## Setup and repair

Run:

```sh
python3 <skill folder>/manage.py setup
```

The command creates missing parent directories and files for active targets. It
seeds a missing canonical glossary from `templates/glossary.md`. If
`<data home>/glossary.md` is a symlink — for example into a dotfiles repo —
setup writes through it to the linked file and leaves the symlink in place, so
the real glossary is updated where the symlink points rather than being
detached. A self-referential or looping symlink names no real target, and so
does any other symlink that cannot be resolved to one (for example, a link that
points through a regular file). Setup refuses each with an error that names the
cause and a non-zero exit instead of replacing the link with a regular file.

When the canonical glossary does not exist yet — a first installation — offer
the choice of the word the glossary uses for the human in the loop before
running setup, and pass it as `--term`: `operator` (the default), `user`, or
`developer` are the natural choices. Setup substitutes the chosen word for
every `operator` occurrence in the seeded header, capitalizing the
sentence-initial one, so the header reads naturally with that word. When the
canonical glossary already exists, setup keeps its installed word: the word is
read back from the glossary's own header, so header migration and managed-block
sync never revert a chosen word to `operator`. Passing `--term` explicitly
overrides the installed word and migrates the header to it — the way to change
the word later.

In the canonical glossary, the **header region** — everything from the start of
the file through the first line whose content is exactly `---` — is tool-owned
and mirrors `templates/glossary.md` rendered with the glossary's installed
word. Setup brings a stale header up to the current template with that word:
when that region differs, it replaces only the header region and prints
`migrated <path> header to current template`. Everything after the
`---` separator — every term entry — is preserved byte-for-byte, and
migration runs before the managed blocks are generated so both carry the
migrated header in the same run. The migrated header reuses the canonical
file's dominant line-ending style — CRLF for a CRLF file, lone CR for a
classic-Mac CR-only file — so migration never splices a foreign ending onto the
body. When the header already matches, setup makes no change. A canonical file
with no `---` separator is never rewritten, so a hand-written glossary cannot
be clobbered.

For each active global instruction
file, it removes legacy `@.../ai-glossary/glossary.md` lines and all prior
managed blocks, preserves other content, then writes exactly one current block
delimited by:

```text
<!-- ai-glossary:managed:start -->
...
<!-- ai-glossary:managed:end -->
```

The block markers themselves stay LF-delimited. The embedded glossary keeps
the canonical file's dominant line-ending style — CRLF for a CRLF file, lone CR
for a classic-Mac CR-only file — so generating a block never appends a foreign
ending before the end marker. A glossary with no trailing line ending is still
separated from the end marker by one in its own dominant style.

Each generated block carries only the glossary content between its markers; it
does not name the canonical file or embed a synchronization command. Resolution
of the canonical path and sync command lives in this skill and in
`curate-glossary`. After every canonical edit, immediately rerun setup to
resynchronize the managed blocks; a rerun does not duplicate blocks. Report each
path printed by the command; `setup already complete` means no bytes needed
changing.

When a setup run changes at least one file — it creates the glossary, migrates
its header, or synchronizes a target — it prints those change lines instead of
`setup already complete`. In that case print this message to the operator,
verbatim:

> Restart this agent session to load the updated glossary.

A newly written managed block is not in the running session's context until a
new agent session starts, so the operator has to restart for the update to take
effect. Do not print the message for a run that reports `setup already
complete`, and never attempt to reload the harness yourself.

Done when the command exits zero, the canonical glossary exists, each active
global file contains exactly one managed block with its complete content, and —
when the run changed a file — the operator has been told to restart the session.

## Uninstall

Run:

```sh
python3 <skill folder>/manage.py uninstall
```

The command removes every managed block and legacy glossary import line from
both global instruction files while preserving all other content. It leaves
the data home and canonical glossary in place and prints that retained path.

Done when the command exits zero and its retained glossary path has been
reported to the operator.

## Isolated or nonstandard targets

For tests, sandboxes, or explicit nonstandard installations, override every
path without touching live global files:

```sh
python3 <skill folder>/manage.py setup \
  --data-home /absolute/data-home \
  --claude-file /absolute/CLAUDE.md \
  --agents-file /absolute/AGENTS.md
```

`--term` combines with every form above. Use the same options with
`uninstall`. Relative override paths are accepted but
absolute paths make the changed targets unambiguous. An explicitly passed
target is always written, even when it does not yet exist, so this is the way to
install the glossary into a harness that is not yet on disk.
